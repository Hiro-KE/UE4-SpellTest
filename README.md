# UE4-SpellTest
This is a test of a replicated projectile system that mimics Oath projectiles system.
I have had it as a test/study and I am sharing it for whoever wants to implement a similar spell system.
In case you're interested in a full implementation and a more detailed approach, 
please check my game framework here : https://github.com/Hiro-KE/UE4-KizuEngine

- Task 1 : Create a homing target lock system
  - When crosshair is on a player + Range (expose this variable in details pannel) can fire at the character
